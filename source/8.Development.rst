8. Development
==============

This chapter describes the procedures for those willing to contribute to the
project.

Repositories
------------

The entire Fireball project and drivers (aka thunder suite) is spread on several
repositories.
Most of the source code is concentrated on the ``fireball-master`` repository.
The other repositories contain just the source code that is exclusive for the
use of the driver that contains the repository.

When you want to work or develop for the ``Fireball`` driver you need to clone
at least two repositories: fireball-master and fireball-fireball

   git clone git@github.com:fireball-dft/fireball-fireball
   git clone git@github.com:fireball-dft/fireball-master
