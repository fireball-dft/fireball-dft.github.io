Driver: Fireball
================

The driver _Fireball_ is composed of two executables ``fireball.x`` and
``fireball-MDET.x``.
The purpose of the driver is to compute the electronic structure from the
precomputed interactions and wavefunctions.
The driver works with the wave-functions created by the driver Begin and the
interactions created by the driver Create.
The interactions are stored in the Fdata directory (old style) or the new HDF5
Fdata.hdf (new style).
